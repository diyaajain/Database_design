## Overview

This database is designed to store data related to NBA coaches and teams. Users can send simple queries to retrieve data and add new data to the database. The database has two tables (or relations) - one for coaches and one for teams.

## How to use the code: 

1. Download the zip file and uncompress it.
2. Ideal IDE to run the code would be Visual Studio Code.
3. Run the code with the appropriate java extensions.
4. I used the c.txt and t.txt for the test cases while running the code.
